**The dangers of misspelling a url in a single folder.**

In this repository you will find a lot of web pages that try to impersonate giant companies, the purpose of this is to keep you safe and raise awareness of the dangers that can occur when we misspell a web page.

Remember that if you are going to open these web pages, it is necessary to take **security measures** before, for example:

- Using a virtual machine
- Create a new and unused e-mail address.
- Delete all passwords from your google account.
- Use a new phone number (if necessary).

(If someone promised you that something incredible would happen if you opened these pages please do not believe them, they are trying to take your personal data)
